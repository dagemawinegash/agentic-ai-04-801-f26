# multi_agent.py, Week 4: role specialization as a sequential pipeline
# Pattern: Data -> Analysis -> Report. Three roles, three capability sets.
# Core idea: separation of concerns is ENFORCED by tool access, not requested
# by prompt. The Analysis agent cannot fetch data; it does not have the tools.
